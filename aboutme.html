    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Hello! My name is Shun Akiya, a 15 year old sophomore at Palm Desert High 
    School. I am fascinated with Computer Science and would like to pursue 
    aerospace engineering or game designing. I have been involved with computer science
    and robotics for almost 8 years, and I have great knowledge on how to code advanced C++ 
    and Robot C' from competing in Botball at Global Conference on 
    Educational Robotics (GCER) during my middle school years.</strong></p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>Some experiences that I 
    posse that relates to Computer Science is the fact that I have participated
    in multiple international robotics events, as I stated previously. During my 
    time competing in Botball, I have been awarded the "Best Use of Sensors" award, 
    "Most Unique Robot Design" award, a trophy for getting 1st place in seeding
    rounds twice, alliance games 3 times, and 2nd place in double eliminations 
    4 times. Throughout my experience in competing, I have learned that the best
    way to go through hard times is just to have fun, and to always have positive
    people around you. I was fortunate enough to have very intelligent and 
    positive people around me, which has helped me and my team greatly. 
    Also, keep in mind that since GCER is an international event, there are
    hundreds of teams competing against you, which makes it harder for you to 
    stay focused and to not be overwhelmed by other teams</strong></p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong>In the end, I have decent
    experience with computer science, and my dream is to become an
    aerospace engineer or game designer. Thank you for spending your time reading
    my introduction, and I hope you will explore the rest of my website. Have a
    great day!</strong></p>
