                <p>The project was completed and programmed by Shun Akiya and Daniel Verdugo. 
                The project’s theme is around a randomized quiz where users answer 10 randomized 
                questions that are related to World War II. While we were programming the quiz, 
                there were definitely some difficulties that we encountered. The 1st problem was 
                not implementing a while loop. In the beginning, we completed our program with 
                everything that was needed; but we completely forgot to add a while loop somewhere
                in the program. We resolved this problem by coming up with a clever idea, which 
                was implementing a while loop so that every time the player answers a question with
                a lowercase letter, the program would ask the user to answer with a valid input, 
                which in this case is to answer with capital letters. (A, B, C, D,). For example, if
                a user answers a question with a lowercase letter, the program will take the user back
                to the question that they were on and will print “Enter A, B, C or D must be in caps.”
                The 2nd problem that we encountered was implementing the randomizer in the program, 
                which we soon found out that it was a very simple solution. The solution was to replace 
                the original randomizer we had before, print(random.shuffle(function)), to print(random.shuffle(function)).
                The part of the program that Shun worked on was coming up with the questions, the while 
                loops for the quiz, and the some of the question functions. The part of the program that Daniel
                worked on was coming up with the questions, figuring out the randomization of the questions and
                the rest of the question functions.</p>
