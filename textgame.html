                <p>You wake up on a beach in the middle of the wreckage of your private plane. 
                You look around and find that you are on a tropical island with jungles and a 
                mountain further inland; and you find that the sun is right above your head, 
                which means that it is sometime in the afternoon. The last thing that you remember
                is going on vacation to the Bahama islands with your friends during a storm; your
                initial plan was to go the Bahamas to spend time with your family that lives there. 
                You search through the remains of the plane, and gather some materials; but your friends 
                are nowhere to be found. Once you gather materials (batteries, snacks, water, etc.) and 
                explore the island more, you notice that there are footprints on the shore, which leads 
                to the suspicion that your friends are somewhere on the island, but you are not able to 
                locate them. You start following the footprints, and after following them for 30 minutes, 
                the footprints head inland from the beach into the jungle. You continue to follow the 
                footsteps, and after a little bit, you find that they lead towards the mountain and you
                suspect that your friends are most likely at the top or near the mountain. You hike to the
                bottom of the mountain, and you finally see Nolan. You ask him whether or not if he knows
                where his friends are, but he does not have an answer. But the sun is going down, and you 
                can not waste time asking him more questions. You and Nolan start making a fire, and start 
                gathering materials in order to create shelter. You are about to sleep, but you hear a rattling 
                around in the distance, near the bushes. You find out that it was your friends, Aaron and Emily.
                The only person that is left is Kylie, and you start searching for her after you fall asleep. 
                You and your friends go back to the plane, and you see that Kylie is there looting the remains
                of the plane. She explains that she found a satellite phone at the pilotâ€™s cockpit, but does not 
                have enough altitude for a good connection in order to make a phone call to the emergency service. 
                Then, Aaron makes a suggestion that climbing the mountain is the best form of gaining altitude, 
                and everyone agrees on it. After looting the plane for awhile, you and your friends gather enough
                materials and resources to climb the mountain. You and your friends head back to where you and Nolan
                created a camp, and you and your friends start climbing the mountain. After an hour, you and your
                friends reach the summit of the mountain, and Kylie starts making the phone call to the emergency
                service. 3 hours later, the emergency service arrive, and you and your friends safely and successfully
                leave the island, and go to your families house.</p>
                
                <p>The very first step for the project was to come up with a good
                topic for the whole project. Once me and my partner came up with
                a good topic, we started coding. The code is pretty basic, just 
                some variables and functions in order for the program to actually 
                work. The difficulties that we encountered were that we didn't have
                the functions in the right spot, and also that we were stuggling
                in the very beginning in the making of the text adventure project.
                We resolved it by asking for help, and that was pretty much it.</p>
